==========

An experimental module to read in the image setting presets and dynamically map them to another preset, or to not show the image, based on device. When the setting is to not show the image for a specific device it remove the image from the DOM as well as the http request for the image.

This will utilize either adapt.js, straight CSS3vmedia queries or a PHP solution to determine the users device.

Via the settings, the UI will allow the user to map an image preset to another or to display no image at all for that device.
